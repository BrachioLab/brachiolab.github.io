1. To test on `localhost:4444`, use `python3 -m http.server 4444`
2. To add people and papers, add entries to `assets/group.yml` and `assets/papers.yml`. 
3. Custom CSS that deviates from the MiniPort template is in `assets/css/custom.css`
4. Custom javascript that populates the papers and people are in `assets/js/papers.js` and `assets/js/people.js`. 

A super simple responsive portfolio template. It's only a single page because hey, sometimes
you don't need a half dozen pages to make your point.
